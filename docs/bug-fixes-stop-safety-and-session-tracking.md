# Bug Fixes: Stop Safety and Session Tracking

## Overview

This document summarizes critical bug fixes implemented to resolve safety issues and improve session management in the WorkOn workspace bootstrapper. The fixes address several major issues that could cause data loss and system instability.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. **CRITICAL SECURITY**: Stop Command Closing Unrelated Terminals

**Problem**: The `workon stop` command was closing ALL terminal windows on the system, not just the ones spawned by WorkOn. This was extremely dangerous as it could close terminals running important processes or cause data loss.

**Root Cause**: The cleanup system used broad window searches:
- `xdotool search --class "Alacritty"` - Found ALL Alacritty terminals
- `xdotool search --classname "Alacritty"` - Found ALL terminals with that instance
- `wmctrl -c "Alacritty"` - Closed ALL Alacritty windows

**Solution**: 
- **Disabled broad class-based searches** for terminal applications
- **Disabled broad instance-based searches** for safety
- **Added terminal class blacklist** (Alacritty, kitty, xterm, gnome-terminal) for wmctrl
- **Enhanced specific window targeting** using window IDs when available
- **Graceful failure** when specific targeting isn't possible

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/cleanup.sh`: Enhanced safety checks and specific window targeting

### 2. **Session Management**: Duplicate Session Entries

**Problem**: Session files contained duplicate entries (8 instead of 5), causing multiple cleanup attempts for the same resources and confusing stop operations.

**Root Cause**: 
- Immediate PID tracking created initial session entries
- AwesomeWM callbacks triggered later and created additional entries
- Deduplication logic wasn't working due to timing and metadata differences

**Solution**:
- **Enhanced deduplication** in callback handling
- **In-place session updates** instead of creating new entries
- **Proper handling of asynchronous callbacks**
- **Preserved tracking method metadata**

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/spawn_resources.lua`: Added callback deduplication logic
- `lib/lua-workon/src/session.lua`: Enhanced append function

### 3. **AwesomeWM Compatibility**: Lua Script Errors

**Problem**: AwesomeWM was showing error notifications:
- `spawn_resources.lua:128: attempt to get length of a function value (field tags)`
- `spawn_resources.lua:136: bad argument #1 to 'client_tags' (client expected, got no value)`

**Root Cause**: AwesomeWM v4.3 changed API where `screen.tags` and `c.tags` became functions instead of direct table properties.

**Solution**:
- **Dynamic API detection** for both `screen.tags` and `c.tags`
- **Proper function calling** with correct parameters
- **Backward compatibility** maintained

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/spawn_resources.lua`: Added function detection and proper calling

### 4. **Desktop Application Resolution**: XDG Desktop Entry Support

**Problem**: `workon resolve ide` incorrectly reported "File/Command exists: No" for desktop applications like `dev.zed.Zed` even though they worked with `pls-open`.

**Root Cause**: The `path_resource_exists()` function only checked files, commands in PATH, and URLs, but didn't understand XDG desktop application IDs.

**Solution**:
- **Added desktop ID pattern recognition** (reverse domain notation)
- **Integrated with `pls-open --dry-run`** for validation
- **Enhanced path resolution logic**

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/path.sh`: Enhanced `path_resource_exists()` function

## Debugging Infrastructure Added

### Comprehensive Debug Logging

**New Debug Capabilities**:
- **CLI flags**: `--debug`, `--verbose`, `--dry-run`
- **File-based Lua logging**: `/tmp/workon-lua-debug.log`
- **Stop operation logging**: `/tmp/workon-stop-debug.log`
- **Pre-flight system validation**
- **Enhanced error capture and reporting**

**Files Added/Modified**:
- `lib/debug.sh`: New comprehensive debug infrastructure
- `bin/workon`: Enhanced CLI with debug flags
- `lib/spawn.sh`: Added debug pipeline integration
- `lib/cleanup.sh`: Added stop operation debugging

## Technical Implementation Details

### Session Deduplication Algorithm

```lua
-- Check if resource already exists before adding callback data
local session_data, err = session.read_session(session_file)
local already_tracked = false
if session_data and not err then
    for _, existing_entry in ipairs(session_data) do
        if existing_entry.name == resource.name and existing_entry.pid == c.pid then
            already_tracked = true
            -- Update existing entry with window metadata
            existing_entry.window_id = c.window and tostring(c.window) or ""
            existing_entry.class = c.class or ""
            existing_entry.instance = c.instance or ""
            existing_entry.name_prop = c.name or ""
            session.write_session_atomic(session_file, session_data)
            break
        end
    end
end
```

### Safe Window Cleanup Strategy

```bash
# Strategy 1: Use specific window ID when available (safest)
if [[ -n $window_id ]]; then
    xdotool windowclose "$window_id"
fi

# Strategy 2: Skip dangerous class-based searches for terminals
if [[ "$class" == "Alacritty" || "$class" == "kitty" || "$class" == "xterm" ]]; then
    # Skip - too dangerous, could close unrelated terminals
fi

# Strategy 3: PID-based cleanup with graceful/force termination
kill -TERM "$pid" && sleep 1 && kill -KILL "$pid"
```

### AwesomeWM API Compatibility

```lua
-- Handle both function and table-based tag access
local screen_tags = screen.tags
if type(screen_tags) == "function" then
    screen_tags = screen_tags()
end

local client_tags = c.tags
if type(client_tags) == "function" then
    client_tags = client_tags(c)
end
```

## Testing and Validation

### Safety Verification

1. **Terminal Safety**: Verified that `workon stop` no longer closes unrelated terminals
2. **Session Consistency**: Confirmed session files contain exactly 5 entries (not 8)
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Verified each resource is processed exactly once
4. **Error Handling**: Confirmed graceful failure when cleanup methods unavailable

### Debug Verification

1. **Lua Error Resolution**: No more AwesomeWM error notifications
2. **Desktop App Resolution**: `workon resolve ide` correctly identifies desktop applications
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Debug logs provide detailed troubleshooting information
4. **Tag Assignment**: Callback-based tag enforcement working correctly

## Impact and Benefits

### Security Improvements
- **Eliminated terminal closure risk**: Users can safely run `workon stop` without fear of losing work
- **Precise resource targeting**: Only WorkOn-spawned applications are affected
- **Graceful error handling**: Failed cleanup attempts don't cause system issues

### Reliability Improvements
- **Consistent session management**: Eliminated duplicate tracking confusion
- **Better resource cleanup**: More reliable termination of spawned applications
- **Enhanced error reporting**: Clear feedback when operations fail

### Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive debugging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting issues
- **Better error messages**: Clear indication of what's working vs failing
- **Enhanced validation**: Pre-flight checks ensure system compatibility

## Remaining Known Issues

### Minor Functionality Issue
- **Zed tag placement**: Zed editor spawns on current tag instead of assigned tag 1
- **Impact**: Low - Zed appears but requires manual tag switching
- **Workaround**: Manually switch to tag 1 to access Zed
- **Root cause**: GUI applications don't trigger AwesomeWM callbacks; `spawn_properties.tag` appears to be ignored for some applications

## Files Modified Summary

### Core Functionality
- `lib/cleanup.sh`: Safe window cleanup and terminal protection
- `lib/spawn_resources.lua`: Session deduplication and AwesomeWM compatibility
- `lib/lua-workon/src/session.lua`: Enhanced session management
- `lib/path.sh`: Desktop application resolution

### Debug Infrastructure
- `lib/debug.sh`: Comprehensive debug logging and validation
- `bin/workon`: Enhanced CLI with debug flags
- `lib/spawn.sh`: Debug pipeline integration

### Total Changes
- **7 files modified**
- **~300 lines of code added/modified**
- **0 breaking changes** - all modifications maintain backward compatibility

## Conclusion

These fixes resolve critical safety issues that could cause data loss and system instability. The WorkOn stop command is now completely safe, session management is reliable, and comprehensive debugging infrastructure supports ongoing development and troubleshooting.

The remaining Zed tag placement issue is a minor functionality enhancement that doesn't impact core safety or reliability.
